# Random Quotes
Fun random quotes web app.  App is built using Microsoft's ASP.NET core framework and it's very simple.

This is a copy of the [Octopus Deploy RandomQuotes application](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/RandomQuotes), some modifications have been made to the code to upgrade to .NET 6. 

This code is used by [Sarah Lean](https://www.twitter.com/techielass) during demos and presentations for Octopus Deploy. 

Within this repository you will find: 
- The Application Code
- The Azure Bicep Infrastructure templates
- The GitHub Actions workflows to build the application and pass to Octopus Deploy for deployment and the workflow that packages the Bicep templates to a zip file and then passes it to Octopus for deployment.
